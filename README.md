# DS404 Big Data Computing
 This repository includes the R code associated with the assignments for the course "Big Data Computing" in form of R Markdown files which can be rendered into HTML files. Starting with general code profiling and code optimization to optimize RAM and time usage, it is continued with efficiently working with massive data locally. Then, it is focused on parallel computing both locally and on a computing cluster. In addition, remote computing based on a Linux machine in the bwCloud is used. Finally, Spark is introduced to efficently handle very large datasets.
